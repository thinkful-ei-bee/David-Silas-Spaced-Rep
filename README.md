# Spaced Repetition Capstone

Learn the Italian language with spaced repetition. Each user is given a set of words to translate, and when you get it 
right, you get a point. The words you struggle with the most show up more often, and the ones you're comfortable with
show up less often. It's proven to work!

This project is focused on using the linked list data structure in its database. It is also a crash course in full-stack,
cooperative development. It was finished in four days.
